# master

 - BREAKING: removed waitForAnimations in favor of animationsSettled. It works better with new style async Ember tests.
 - BREAKING: transitions now received the TransitionContext as an argument instead of as `this`.
 - BREAKING: the TransitionContext no longer has an `animate` method. Instead, Motions are defined to export functions that automatically animate.
 - BREAKING: the signature for defining a Motion has changed. By convention, your default export should be function that creates and starts the motion, and you should also offer a named export for your Motion subclass so that others can extend from it.
 - BREAKING: rules functions get named arguments instead of positional arguments.
 - BREAKING: renamed animated-bind component to animated-value. "bind" made sense in the context of early Ember, it's not really a thing people say anymore.
