# Motions

A motion is responsible for animating a single sprite and taking into account whatever motions were previously running on that sprite. Motions represent the change in state or category of a sprite, and they manage continuity from one animation to the next. Every category of sprite is assigned a motion. Because all sprites are apart of a list, multiple states can exist simultaneously. --insert all built in motions and basic descriptions--
